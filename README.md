## Project Overview

The Restaurant Booking App allows users to:

- Create an account and log in securely.
- Make, update, and cancel bookings.

## UX / Design

### Strategy

The app was designed for:

- **Customers** who want a quick way to reserve tables online.
- **Restaurant staff** who need a reliable admin interface.

### Scope

- Core booking CRUD functionality.
- Authentication with Django Allauth.
- Responsive design for mobile-first use.

### Structure

Navigation is consistent across all pages:

- Home
- Menu
- Bookings (Profile)
- Login/Logout/Signup

### Surface

- **Colours**: Neutral background with an orange accent (#e09f3e) for CTAs.
- **Typography**: Bootstrap defaults (clean and readable).
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast buttons, semantic HTML.

## Features

### Implemented

- **Authentication**: signup, login, logout.
- **Bookings CRUD**:
  - Create booking (date/time validation).
  - View bookings table.
  - Update booking (status resets to pending).
  - Cancel booking.
- **Menu browsing** with Back button on detail pages.
- **Profile welcome message** with logged-in user’s name.
- **Sticky footer** on all pages.

## Data Model

The main model is **Booking** with fields:

- `user`

- `special_requests`

Relationships:

- One User → Many Bookings.
- Bookings may be linked to Tables.

- Tasks moved across _To Do → In Progress → Review → Done_.
- Iterative development with frequent testing.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Each feature was manually tested.

Example (Bookings CRUD):

## Known Issues / Bugs

- [ ] Signup form styling could be further polished.
- [ ] High-contrast button colours still need design refinement.

---

### Validator Testing

- **HTML**: W3C Validator → Pass.
- **CSS**: Jigsaw Validator → Pass.
- **Python**: flake8 → Pass.
- **Accessibility**: Lighthouse audit → Good contrast and structure.

### Responsiveness

Tested on:

- Chrome DevTools (mobile + tablet + desktop).
- Real devices (Android + Windows laptop).

Results: layout adapts, footer sticky, no horizontal overflow.

### Bugs Fixed

- **Naive vs Aware datetime bug** → fixed with timezone-aware validation.
- **Floating footer** → fixed with flexbox layout.
- **Low contrast auth forms** → styled in `fixes.css`.
